	Oh freddled gruntbuggly,<br/>
	Thy micturations are to me,(with big yawning)<br/>
	As plurdled gabbleblotchits,<br/>
	On a lurgid bee,<br/>
	That mordiously hath blurted out,<br/>
	Its earted jurtles, grumbling<br/>
	Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]<br/>
	Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,<br/>
	Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,<br/>
	And living glupules frart and stipulate,<br/>
	Like jowling meated liverslime,<br/>
	Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,<br/>
	And hooptiously drangle me,<br/>
	With crinkly bindlewurdles,mashurbitries.<br/>
	Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,<br/>
	See if I don't!<br/>
	(I probably won't!)
