		An introduction, always needed,

		in our hearts, the hope has seeded,

		for our captain, who decreed it,

		thus begins my sacred tome.
	</p>
<break>

</break>
	<p>
	As the weather grows much colder,

		and our souls grow ever bolder,

		under orders, now a soldier,

		sitting in our newfound home.
	</p>
<break>

</break>
	<p>
		Though spirits may grow weary,

		deep within the midnights dreary,

		with our vision now so bleary,

		we place our craft within the loam.
	</p>
<break>

</break>
	<p>
		So the learning shared between us,

		blinding hope to those who've seen us,

		and despair may yet demean us,

		unfamiliar worlds we roam.
